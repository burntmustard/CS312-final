# More of an Apology than a README

Sorry, I didn’t have much time to make this because I procrastinated and have another assignment due tonight. I hope my grade can survive losing the 23 points from not doing this properly.

However, I wanted to thank you (assuming this is Cici — but if it's a TA, you were also pretty darn great) for a great class this term, despite it being at 8:00/8:30. I look forward to seeing you next year during the practicum!

I hope you have a great summer!

*(P.S. I know the total points for this section is 25, but I have no spelling errors or mistakes, so I should get two points — not that I need them.)*
